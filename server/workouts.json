Back extensions are often done for high reps without weight, but when done with weight, they can be an excellent accessory movement for deadlift strength as well as an overall posterior-chain strength builder. Because your back is the limiting factor, it's still an exercise that is usually done for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or higher. You can weight it with a plate or by holding a dumbbell or other weight in your hands. Use 70-80% 1RM, rest 60s.",

    "instructions": "The dumbbell front squat is a popular exercise for targeting the muscles of the lower body, including the quadriceps, glutes, and hamstrings. Holding dumbbells in the racked position also works the core and upper-back muscles to maintain posture while the lower body moves. Because the amount of weight you can use will be limited by what you can clean to the rack position, this movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set or more. If this movement hurts your knees, try performing it with a wider stance. Use 70-80% 1RM, rest 60s.",
